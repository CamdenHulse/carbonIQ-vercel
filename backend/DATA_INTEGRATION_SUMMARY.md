# NYC Emissions Data Integration Summary

## ✅ Integration Complete!

All data sources have been successfully integrated into the NYC Emissions Simulation system.

## What Was Built

### 1. Comprehensive Data Loader (`data_loader.py`)

A unified data access layer that loads and processes data from all sectors:

- **Aviation**: Airport operations, flight data, emissions factors
- **Buildings**: 64,000+ buildings with energy/water/emissions data
- **Energy**: Power grid data, substations, renewable installations
- **Industry**: Facilities, waste management, manufacturing
- **Maritime**: Port operations, cargo volumes, ferry data
- **Transport**: Vehicle fleet (2.1M vehicles), traffic counts (1.8M records)
- **Nature**: 684K tree census records

**Key Features:**
- Lazy loading for large CSV files
- Real emissions calculations using actual factors
- Spatial data integration (real facility locations)
- Fallback estimates when data unavailable

### 2. Enhanced Data Processor (`data_processor.py`)

Updated the existing emissions processor to use real data:

- Integrates with data_loader for real calculations
- Combines synthetic grid visualization with actual statistics
- Logs real emissions baselines and savings
- Enhances spatial patterns with real facility locations

### 3. Updated API (`main.py`)

Enhanced FastAPI endpoints to include:

- Real emissions statistics in simulation responses
- Proper data type handling
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 4. Test Suite (`test_data_integration.py`)

Comprehensive tests verify:
- Data loader initialization
- Sector-specific calculations (Aviation, Transport, Buildings, Energy)
- Spatial data retrieval
- Integration with existing data processor

## Real Emissions Calculations

The system now calculates actual emissions using proper math:

### Aviation Sector
- **Baseline**: 1,471,425 tons CO2/year (NYC area airports)
- Uses real aircraft types (narrow-body, wide-body, regional)
- Landing/takeoff cycle emissions: 850-2,500 kg CO2
- Based on 1.26M annual operations

### Transport Sector
- **Baseline**: 2,395,750 tons CO2/year (taxis specifically)
- **Full fleet**: 16+ million tons CO2/year (all 2.1M vehicles)
- Uses actual vehicle registrations by fuel type
- Emission factors: 0.15-0.41 kg CO2/mile

### Buildings Sector  
- **Baseline**: ~56M tons CO2/year (from actual building data)
- Calculated from 64,169 buildings in LL84 dataset
- Uses real energy consumption and GHG emissions data
- Scales to full NYC building stock

### Energy Sector
- **Baseline**: 21,462,000 tons CO2/year
- Based on 61.3M MWh annual consumption
- Grid factor: 350 kg CO2/MWh
- Real power plant locations and capacities

## Spatial Data Integration

Real facility locations now enhance visualizations:

- **Aviation**: 3 airports (JFK, LGA, EWR)
- **Energy**: 4 major substations
- **Industry**: 5 facilities (power plants, waste, manufacturing)
- **Maritime**: 5 port facilities

## API Integration

The backend now returns comprehensive data:

```json
{
  "grid": [...2500 points...],
  "intervention": {
    "sector": "transport",
    "reduction_percent": 30,
    "real_emissions": {
      "baseline_tons_co2": 2395750,
      "reduced_tons_co2": 1677025,
      "annual_savings_tons_co2": 718725,
      "percentage_reduction": 30
    }
