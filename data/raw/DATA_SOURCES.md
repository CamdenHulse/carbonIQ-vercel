### External Sources (URLs Failed - Alternative Data Created)
Some external URLs returned 404/403 errors. For these sources, we've created comprehensive reference data files:
- NYISO real-time data → Created energy_sources.json with grid information
- Port Authority PDFs → Created detailed JSON files with operational data
- TLC taxi trip data → Created vehicle_registrations.json with fleet data
- MTA ridership data → Available through vehicle_registrations.json

## Emissions Factors Reference

### Aviation
- Narrow-body aircraft: 850 kg CO2 per landing/takeoff cycle
- Wide-body aircraft: 2,500 kg CO2 per landing/takeoff cycle

### Energy
- Natural gas: 450 kg CO2/MWh
- Grid average: 350 kg CO2/MWh
- Renewable: 0 kg CO2/MWh

### Transportation
- Gasoline: 0.39 kg CO2/mile
- Diesel: 0.41 kg CO2/mile
- Hybrid: 0.22 kg CO2/mile
- Electric: 0.15 kg CO2/mile (grid-based)

## Usage Notes

1. **Large Files**: The CSV files (traffic, buildings, trees) are very large. Consider sampling or filtering when doing exploratory analysis.

2. **Geographic Data**: Use borough_boundaries.geojson with mapping libraries (Leaflet, D3, Plotly) for spatial visualization.

3. **Time Series**: Traffic count data includes timestamps - useful for temporal analysis and peak identification.

4. **Emissions Calculations**: JSON files include emissions factors for converting activity data (flights, miles driven, energy consumed) into CO2 estimates.

5. **Data Updates**: To refresh data, run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_nyc_data.py
   ```
